# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data using a Neural Network

In this project, we build a neural network from scratch and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership, in order to have a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before moving to higher-level tools such as PyTorch.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The code has been run and tested with the following software and libraries:

```
python - 3.8.3
jupyter - 1.0.0
numpy - 1.18.5
pandas - 1.0.5
matplotlib - 3.2.2
```

### Installing

These are the steps required to download and run the project.

* Clone repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/anderarias/project-bike-sharing-patterns-prediction.git
```

* Move to code directory:

```
cd project-bike-sharing-patterns-prediction
```

* Activate and open jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
